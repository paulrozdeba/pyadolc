=============================

Short Description:
    This PYADOLC, a Python module to differentiate complex algorithms written in Python.
    It wraps the functionality of the library ADOL-C (C++).

EXAMPLE USAGE::

    import numpy
    from adolc import *
    N = M = 10
    A = numpy.zeros((M,N))
    A[:] = [[ 1./N +(n==m) for n in range(N)] for m in range(M)]
    def f(x):
        return numpy.dot(A,x)

    # tape a function evaluation
    ax = numpy.array([adouble(0) for n in range(N)])
    trace_on(1)
    independent(ax)
    ay = f(ax)
    dependent(ay)
    trace_off()

    x = numpy.array([n+1 for n in range(N)])

    # compute jacobian of f at x
    J = jacobian(1,x)

    # compute gradient of f at x
    if M==1:
        g = gradient(1,x)


THIS VERSION OF PYADOLC IS KNOWN TO WORK WITH:

    * Ubuntu Linux, Python 2.7.3, NumPy 1.8.0
    * Debian Stretch Linux, Python 2.7.13, NumPy 1.13.1
    * OSX 10.9 (Mavericks), Python 2.7.6, NumPy 1.8.0
    * OSX 10.11 (El Capitan), Python 2.7.11, NumPy 1.10.11


REQUIREMENTS:
    * C and C++ compiler
    * Python and Numpy, both with header files
    * ADOL-C, official versions from http://www.coin-or.org/projects/ADOL-C.xml
    * ColPack from http://cscapes.cs.purdue.edu/download/ColPack
    * boost::python from http://www.boost.org/ or from the apt-get repository.

INSTALLATION UBUNTU / DEBIAN (Stretch):

    * install boost-python via apt-get
    * install autotools-dev libtool libboost-all-dev
    * Use ``./bootstrap.sh`` to download ADOL-C and ColPack and compile them.
    * Run ``python setup.py`` and follow the instructions

INSTALLATION OSX:

    * Run::

        brew install wget
        brew install automake
        brew install shtool
        brew install libtool
        brew install boost@1.59
        brew install boost-python@1.59
        brew link boost@1.59 --force
        brew link boost-python@1.59 --force
    
    * If you installed homebrew in the default location ``/usr/local``, you can skip this step.  Otherwise, if you installed homebrew somewhere else on your system, you will need to edit ``bootstrap.sh`` and ``setup.py``.  First, in the ColPack build section of ``bootstrap.sh``, add the flags::
        
        --with-boost-libdir='<homebrew_libdir>' --with-boost-includedir='<homebrew_includedir>'
      to the end of the ``./configure`` commands, where ``<homebrew_libdir>`` and ``<homebrew_includedir>`` are the locations of homebrew's ``lib`` and ``include`` directories, respectively.  Similarly, edit setup.py so that ``BOOST_DIR = '<homewbrew_root>'`` where ``<homebrew_root>`` is the base directory of your homebrew install (where ``lib``, ``include``, ... are located).
    
    * Run::

        ./bootstrap.sh
        CC=clang CXX=clang++ python setup.py build
        python setup.py install

   You may have to run ``brew link automake`` to generate symbolic links.


TEST YOUR INSTALLATION:

    * install nose, matplotlib, e.g., via pip install nose matplotlib
    * add pyadolc to your python path
    * run ``python -c "import adolc; adolc.test()"``.
      All tests should pass.
    * If anything goes wrong, please file a bug report.

    .. warning::

        If you run the test from the root folder of pyadolc you will get ``ImportError: No module named _adolc`` since it first looks in the local folder ``./adolc`` before trying the other directories in your PYTHONPATH.


MANUAL INSTALLATION:

    Follow the steps in ``./bootstrap.sh`` and adapt if necessary.
